28/4
Concept ideas:
•	Color sorting
•	Driving
•	Play music
•	Mice detection
•	Give different lights
Maybe a note for each color -> create a melody for sorting, the robot remembers the order of the package colors and the note that is linked to it and after sorting it plays the melody again.
Maybe a robotic arm that puts the packages at a certain place. Another idea was to play chess with the packages.
First deadline: finish the rpc list.
The robot can stack the packages in a certain construction.
We made a material list.
Next meeting Monday 2 may at 2.15pm.
